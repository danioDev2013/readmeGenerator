<h1 align="center">ReadMe Generator 👋</h1> 
 
## Description 

This is a command-line application created to generate professional readme.md files from the user's inputs using node.js packages. I needed to create something to help me keep more focus on my projects and less time spent on creating readme files. 

    I learned: 
        * node.js
        * how node packages work
        * working with promises
        * inquirer package
        * generating files
        * badges
    
    Things I further understood:
        * JavaScript (const, prompts, init)
